Tufte CSS by Dave Liepmann

From today's HackerNews: a Tufte CSS project by Dave Liepmann. Cool! https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/

If you haven't looked at Professor Tufte's work, it is old-school information design. https://www.edwardtufte.com/books/

One of ET's guiding principles is to present the viewer with your information and then get out of the way. His books reflect this philosophy in their layout. They are a pleasure to read.

Mr. Liepmann's CSS reflects ET's book very nicely. The typography is great! The printed version actually prints! It's very well thought out!

Well done, Mr. Liepmann! And thank you! https://www.daveliepmann.com/

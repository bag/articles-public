# Grok and Claude
Recently I spent a good amount of time working with [Claude](https://claude.ai/) ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)'s AI) to edit my résumé and [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bgreen/). I asked him to **_Please be direct and useful, no fluff needed_**.

He was nice. His responses, even the ones that seemed like they were meant to be very direct, were measured and respectful. He reminded me of a patient and encouraging college professor or private tutor. When we were done it felt like we accomplished a lot of work, and I was happy with the result.

Then I decided to run everything by [Grok](Grok), ([X](https://x.com/)'s AI).

He was different!

Before we proceed, a disclaimer: I've worked with both Grok and Claude previously, and also with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/)'s [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app). I've even experimented with [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) and [Meta](https://www.meta.com/)'s [Llama](https://www.llama.com/).

I told Grok to **_Be brutal_**. And he was! He called me out on very many things that Claude did not mention. It felt like he was a mohawk mate punching me out on my weaknesses because he cared about me performing my best. I felt more than a little bit beat up and sore after our conversation. But I knew he was right and I was stronger for it.

Here's a working theory: the two AIs reflect the nature of their owners. Grok is irreverent, and operates right now to get things done right now — and cares about the result, but not your feelings. Claude is academic and kindly, and is there to help. He definitely cares about your feelings, and knows that the result will improve over time in the long run — so no abrupt changes, only incremental improvements.

My conclusion: for writing, I prefer Grok. His directness is spicy salsa, but it is much more valuable.
